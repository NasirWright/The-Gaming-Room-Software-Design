# The-Gaming-Room-Software-Design
The Gaming Room was a client who wanted to optimize their system for a web based application to runing efficiently and being able to operate on diffrent platforms.The software that was implemented by Mac is what surfficed for their application.
While developing this documentation, I found that it was easy for me to pick the proper operating system that fit all of the client's requirements.
The part of the process that was most helpful was developing a UML diagram with all of the specifics outlined.
One part in particular I would choose to revise would be the pros and cons section of each operating plaform. Even though i believe the right one was picked, I think another system could possibly surfficed.
Interpreting the user's needs is important because it will make the job easier of implementing the client's needs.
First, defining what the client's needs are is what is essential to the design itself. Things like a specified outline of all the requirements should be laid out for the developer before implementation.
